    // LOCAL STORAGE BITCHES ! (it's an object in your browser you can see in your console when you log it)

  // NOW THE NEXT PROBLEM is to also preserve the emoji checkbox
  function toggleDone(e) {
    // console.log(e.target); with this we get two events unless we add this line of code

  // The toggle problem : Please bear in mind that you have to listen not to li that are not always created before the refreshing of the page but to the ul (the parent) that will alays be there to listen to the event happening
  // this is what we call event deleguation : responsible parents taking care of the events of their negligent children
