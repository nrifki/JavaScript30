    // This exercice is only important to understand the source of some bugs that happens because we don't know this shit bro'
    
    // EXERCICE #1

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // we get 100 100

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // we get 200 100

    // works the same way with strings:
    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // we get Wes Wes

    name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // we get Wesley Wes

    // EXERCICE #2

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // we get ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // we get team = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'] but players also becomes = to ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = []concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team[3] = 'Fuck you';
    console.log(team4); // we get ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Fuck you'] while players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team[3] = 'not cool'; // we get ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'not cool'] while players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // EXERCICE #3

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; // we get {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 99} >> so we're just making a reference and not a copy

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { numbe: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2); // we get {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 12, number: 99} while person is still {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80}

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}; // works the same as spreading an array (not sure it's already available, so ask google ;))

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.log(wes);
    // let's create a copy
    const dev = object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'wesley'; // we still get name: 'Wes' when we console log wes and we get wesley when we console log dev
    // so far so good it's a copy and not a reference
    // but what if we do this ?
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'; // we get {twitter: "@coolman", facebook: "wesbos.developper"} in both dev and wes
    // BECAUSE WHEN you use object.assign it only copies one level (but references the others levels)
    // if you need to copy every level (insted of referencing deeper levels) >> go on the internet to find a function that does so (called clone deep)
    // BUT before doing so ask yourself: like really? why? because you'll rarely need that

    // there is though another way to clone all levels that is called the poor man cloning using json
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // this turns it into a string that then is parsed back into an array
